I was born in Paris France, and moved to California when I was 3. I learned
English in pre-school and blended in with Americans by about 2nd grade. My
first language was French and I continue to speak it fluently with my mother
and my family who almost all live in France aside from 2 English cousins.

# Hawaii
From 4th grade to completing my freshmen year of highschool, I lived in 
Hawaii. Here I started my career as a swimmer involuntarily by telling 
my parents I wanted to be a scuba diver, which led to me taking swim lessons
and beginning a swim career that lasted 9 years and 2 scuba dives. Hawaii
was cool but only by moving to Florida did I realize how crazy it was that my
home island of Big Island had the diameter of a 4 hour drive. 

# Florida
Moving to Florida my sophomore year opened my eyes back up to how vast the 
world is. You can drive from Canada to Chille if you wanted to. In Florida
my swim training intensified greatly, and I made forged friendships that will
last a lifetime. I graduated from Riverview Highschool in Sarasota. 

# College in Pensacola
I stopped swimming after highschool because I was so burnt out and I could 
not see myself swimming D1 for another 4 years with scholarships that depended
on it. Although part of me regrets the possibility of making Olympic Trail cuts,
I'm at peace with the decision. Instead of swimming and studying I partied
and had more fun that I deserved for the level of work I was putting into my 
life. Eventually I decided to challenge myself and switched my major to 
philosophy and to learn programming. 

# California
After graduating, I moved to California with some of my close swim team members
from highschool who also took up programming as their career. We program all
day and bash our heads into walls from the bugs we encounter, but it is a 
challenge that is worth doing and we have a good time in the evenings.
