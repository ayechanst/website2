I got into crypto and web development my senior year of college 
after a long talk with the chairman of the philosophy department.
I studied philosophy in college and I was entertaining the thought
of continuing my education and eventually become a philosophy 
professor. My passion for philosophy has no bounds, but the
social and hierarchical structure of academia along with its 
obligations did not match with my life philosophy, so I decided
to go a different route. One of my best friends had been 
programming in web3 for about a year and had talked my ear off 
extensively about blockchains, oracles, and DAOs. I decided to 
give programming a shot.  

# Journey through web development
I started programming mid pandemic when I moved off campus back
to my home town of Sarasota Florida. I was working full time 
as an optical technician at a spectroscopy company called 
Ultrafast Systems. There I assemebled spectrometers start to 
finish and continued full time school when I got home. On 
weekends I wrote some websites with HTML in sublime (is use
emacs now) and used some basic CSS.  

When I went back to college is when I went deeper and learned
JavaScript through simple projects like rock paper scissors
and unit conversion calculators. At this point I tried my hand
at Solidity but the language was too different of a paradigm
and I learned Python instead. I wrote hang man and a dice game
called hog in python. When I graduated, I spent all my time 
doing The Odin Project, a free 
and open source web development course that has almost no
structure so that I could creatively combine my skills to hack
together fully functioning websites.  
 
My skills really took off however after I moved to California 
and had refined all my tools to build quickly and comfortably.
I switched to a split keyboard, learned vim, and learned to use
Doom Emacs. This big location switch and tool improvement helped
me not be bogged down by non-code related problems and I began 
start my own projects. I learned tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript,
Bash and Solidity in a few months to build what I wanted to. By 
building projects that were helpful to me in my own personal 
life, I learned a lot more about programming and work ethic than
any course. 


# The switch from philosophy to web3 development
My favorite branches of philosophy are the ones with no correct
answers, such as aesthetics and ethics, because they generate
endless argumentation. My passion for blockchains stems from 
the groundedness and non-argumentative nature of smart contracts.
Ethics is fun for the sake of arguing, but the idea that certain
things could be agreed upon and executed by logic resonated 
with me deeply, because I do not believe humans are logical
beings. We have a capacity for logic, demonstrated by our 
technological achievements, but in terms of human relations
historically humans have been screwing each other over since the
dawn of time. To me helping the decentralization of not only 
finances, but applications and government structures move into
the mainstream is my preferred way of contributing to humanities
next technological achievement. Philosophy is the puppet master
of all innovation, but engineering is true creation.
