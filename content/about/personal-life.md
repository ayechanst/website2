My first name is Aye Chan with a space in it, it causes a lot of confusion. I was born in France, and I am 
passionate about philosophy, cooking, nature, people, and programming. 

# Education  
I've never been a fan of conventional public schooling, other than all the interesting people who come from all 
walks of life. Pre-college, I went to schools in California, Hawaii, and Florida. After highschool I graduated
from the Univeristy of West Florida where I discovered my passion for philosophy. I started as a marine biology
major due to my love for the ocean having grown up for 6 years in Hawaii. But what I learned in the courses did not
satisfy my deeper cravings for knowledge and what knowledge was, which is why I turned to philosophy.  

# Swimming  
I swam for 9 years starting in Hawaii and quickly progressed into a 4 time Hawaiian state champion in the 50 
and 100 butterfly. I continued to swim when I moved to Florida and the practices were much harder then the 
Hawaiian ones. We had 9 swim practices a week including three 5am morning practices before school and Saturday
practice. Swimming taught me a rigorous work ethic and never to give up no matter how hard and painful the ordeal.  

# Philosophy  
My passion for philosophy was much more than for school but for life in general. Particular niches of philosophy
I enjoyed was the philosophy of science, which reveals that science is not the be-all end-all. Science has gone
through multiple paradigm shifts, and the scientific method is not perfect. The philosophy of science is mainly
epistemological questions. Philosopher argue about what the "goal" of science really is, how well said "goals" 
are being acheived, and if science even aims for truth. The field has hilarious implications and the rabbit
hole is worth going down.  

Ethics is another excellent rabbit hole to explore, and discovering that no ethical frame work is perfect
was a troubling and exciting thought. Perhaps leading to some ethical nihilism, and the analysis and reconstruction
of personal ethical frameworks. The field is a lot more vague and illogical than the philosophy of science which
generates endless discussion topics and possibilities.  

Existentialism is field I am most passionate about as the thought that we are do not choose where we are born,
when we are born, and to a certain degree who we are is fascinating. What we choose to do with our lives is a 
lot more important than pondering existentialist questions, and doing so comes down to the root belief and 
eternally argued position of free will and determinism. I personally believe the world is determistic, but 
behaving as if free will exists is so much more pragmatic in every facet that I do not believe people who claim
the world is determistic operate on that belief, paradoxically.  

# Science  
In a lot more grounded fasion, science is also interesting despite all its pitfalls that can be explored in
the philosophy of science. Computer science is fascinating because of power of abstraction. Using transistors
to control electricity into forming logic gates, then combining logic gates into more complicated ones, and
eventually abstracting into computers, operating systems, and programs is insane to me. The process identical 
to first order logic in epistemology.  

Artificial intelligence is also a big passion of mine as the field is a huge cross between the philosophy of 
mind and computers. I believe there is a lot to learn about ourselves as humans in AI research. There are also
a lot of ethical considerations with AI and its interactions with humans. The movie Ex-machina is one of my 
favorite movies for this reason.
