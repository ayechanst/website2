I studied philosophy in college and my favorite classes were the 
philosophy of science, and critical thinking. I also enjoyed my aesthetic
classes like the philosophy of art, the philosophy of film, and the 
philosophy of mind. Classes I like a bit less was modern philosophy which
covered thinkers between 1600-1800. 

# Personal interest in existentialism 

Existentialism is probably my favorite type of philosophy because it helped
me cope with starting my adult life, away from parental guidance, my 
obligations as a son, and my rigorous swim career. I was studying marine 
biology and partying in college, and not really going anywhere in life. My 
subconscious felt this cognitive dissonance between what I expected of myself
and what my actions were. I was just existing a mediocre existance and studying
existentialism helped me build a frame work for myself that made me happy.  

The main tennet of existentialism is that one doesn't choose their time period
of birth, their geographical location, or their level of wealth. People just 
"spawn" out of their mother's womb where and whenever and then they must choose
what to do with their life. It was a scary yet comforting thought in that 
people can choose to do whatever, and they have limited time to do so before
their eventual death.  

Nietzsche solved my existential dread and lack of life direction with his saying
that happiness is the feeling that resistance is being overcome. As a swimmer
in highschool, my happiness came from the difficulty of being a great swimmer.
However nothing in life was resisting against me in college, except for life
itself but I was not doing anything to overcome that resistance. That is when 
I switched my major to philosophy, and started programming, and seeking things
out that would be a challenge so I could overcome that resistance.  

# Personal interest in post-modernism

My interest in post-modernism stems from school, and the post-modern ideas
they pushed in so many different classes. I do not agree with post-modernism, 
and I was curious about where these ideas came from in the first place. My 
interest in post-modernism comes from how much I disagree with its thesis. 
Post-modernism's own logic invalidates itself and I seek to understand why 
anyone would subscribe to its claims. Whether I agree with the tennets of 
post-modernism or not does not change that it is an interesting field of 
philosophy and contributing to its body of work is one way to try and group
it in some reality.
