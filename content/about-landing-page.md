A little about myself that is not work related

----

# [Journey to Web3](../about/journey)
Slighly work related... but this is how I found myself doing web3 
development as a traditionally educated fresh out of college person.

----

# [Autobiography](../about/autobiography)
I grew up in a lot of places, all of which are mentioned here I give
credit to my environment for shaping me into who I am.

----

# [Philosophical Interests](../about/philosophical-interests)
I didn't study philosophy because it was an easy liberal arts major 
(it was). I studied philosophy because it quenched my thirst for 
knowledge which was something science alone couldn't do.

# [Capstone Project](/capstone.pdf)
In my final univeristy paper, I defend the claim that 
"only androids can be ethical" from 2 different arguments that interfere
with the claim.  

**DISCLAIMER**  
I defended the claim because it was challenging, not because I agree with it.

# Swim Career and Fitness
I grew up a swimmer and fitness is something dear to me.
