# Enter the Transplanetary Trains

> After sitting around in the train station, a robot butler enters the station and you hide behind the gold coins. Looks like he didn't see you. He grabs the huge private key on the desk and walks out the door leading to the platform. Curious, you quietly follow him.

> Outside you see a shiny red locomotive. The butlers a huge stencil 20 feet long on the side of steam engine and the stencil snaps on like a magnet. He then grabs a bucket of black paint and a huge paint brush and runs along the side of the train covering the stencil with paint at lightning speed. He peels the stencil off and the side of the train reads: "**From Address**: 0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F".

> He then moves to the other side of the train, and you quickly change sides of the platform to see what he's doing. He does the same thing but this time the shiny wet paint reads "**To Address**: 0x003a4cc04501E9adecF850313db2d3797DF801a2".

# There are 3 types of trains

1. Trains carrying **value** from one train station to another
2. Contract deployment trains (Trainsformers)
3. Contract execution trains
