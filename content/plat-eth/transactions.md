# Enter the Transplanetary Trains

> After sitting around in the train station, a robot butler enters the station and you hide behind the gold coins. Looks like he didn't see you. He grabs the huge private key on the desk and walks out the door leading to the platform. Curious, you quietly follow him.

> Outside you see a shiny red locomotive. The butlers throws on a huge 20 foot long stencil on the side of steam engine and the stencil snaps on like a magnet. He leaves and comes back with a bucket of black paint and a giant paint brush. Placing the brush at one end of the stencil, he runs along the side of the train covering the stencil with paint at lightning speed. He peels the stencil off and the side of the train reads: "**From Address**: 0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F".

> He then moves to the other side of the train, and you quickly change sides of the platform to see what he's doing. He does the same thing but this time the shiny wet paint reads "**To Address**: 0x003a4cc04501E9adecF850313db2d3797DF801a2".

> The butler moves to the front of the train and places a shorter stencil with the same number as the **nonce** poster inside the train station.

> Then you notice the train has three wagons attatched to it. Suddenly small cranes emerge from compartments hidden in the platform and begin moving these chrome finished metal boxes that glow with turquoise light. Printed on the side of the wagon reads **Input Data**.

> The flying robot with the balance displayed on its back then bursts through the door its arms overflowing with coins and dumps the coins into the second wagon which the side reads **value**. Its picks up the fallen coins on its way back in and tosses them into the wagon before coming outside again with another load of coins, and the balance display on its back decreases with each load.
