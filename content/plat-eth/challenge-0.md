Following along Speed Run Eth's challenge #0 we will learn about the basics and commit to memory the following:

1. Accounts
2. Wallets
3. Transactions
4. Smart Contracts

# Checkpoint 1: ‚õΩÔ∏è Gas & Wallets üëõ

What is a wallet? Wallets manage **accounts**. There are two sorts of accounts, the accounts that wallets manage are EOA (Externally Owned
Accounts). This means the account is owned by a private key.

But enough information and more analogies, lets start with learning about accounts with the following article:

[Accounts are train stations](../accounts)

After reading the accounts article, we can dive into what a wallet is.

In checkpoint 1, we are connecting a burner wallet to the website. How does this signing into a decentralized application work? It works
because...

[Wallets are robot butlers](../wallets)

# Checkpoint 2: üñ® Minting

How did we get an NFT after clicking a simple button?

It's because we sent a **transaction**, what's a transaction?

[Transactions are trains](../transactions)

Ok but where did we send the transaction? We sent it to a smart contract. A smart contract is another type of **account**, but its not a
train station.
