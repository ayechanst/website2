Let's read another story! Remember the [SEE](../pedagogy) Principal!

# The Best Butler

> After leaving the train station feeling inspired to make your own train station, you pull out your smart phone and create a crypto wallet Poof! A robot butler appears in front of you!

> He is humanoid with a square head, lightbulbs for eyes, and a rectagular metal safe for a chest. He has big ears that look like old car horns. He is also holding a shiny black shotgun. On your phone you have a seed phrase from the wallet creation.

> When you whisper your seed phrase in the butler's ears, the circular handle on the safe starts spinning. Faster and faster it spins until the safe swings open. Inside you see a collection of **private keys**, which all belong to you. The butler informs you that your keys are safe with him, and a shell flies out of the shotgun as he cocks it terminator style.
