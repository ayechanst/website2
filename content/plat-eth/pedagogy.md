Platinum Ethereum is a learning program designed to teach about the Ethereum Protocol using analogies all contained within a single cinematic
universe. Why learn about a fictional universe if the goal is to learn about the Ethereum Protocol? Great questions and here's why:

# How do people memorize pi to the 70,000th digit?

These people use special memorization techniques where they store information in the form of familiar objects and stories. The more creative
and outlandish the story is, the better they store and retrieve information. Luckily you won't need to waste time coming up with your own
stories to store knowledge about the Ethereum Protocol, that's what Platinum-Eth is for!

# The S.E.E. Principal

When reading through and learning on Platinum-Eth, do not forget about the SEE Principal. Our brains remember better when we associate information with all our senses, when we exaggerate the information, and when we energize the information.

### S is for Sense

Use all 5 senses to experience Platinum-Eth. See is analogy, for example a train. Smell the air around around the train, does it smell like
charcoal? Taste the air, a bit dry perhaps. Feel the rumbling of the engine in the air, and hear the pistons screaching and squeeling.

### E is for Exaggerate

Think of cartoons, and how everything is exaggerated. Our train can be a shiny new train engine painted red, so shiny it glows! With a huge
chimmeny and oversized wheels? If it sounds ridicoulous, good!

### The second E is for Energize

Bring motion to the pictures. See huge plumes of smoke spouting from the train's chimeny, covering everthing around it with black charcoal
powder. See the conductor slamming the hell out of the tiny bell making the air ring with defeaning noise for miles around!
