I want to write about how I think humans reason about things. It seems like the main structure holding understanding together are models.
I'd argue that everyone has a model of everything they know and understand, and some models are simply better than others. Let's dive into
the specifics.

### Models are always wrong

Of course they are, because a model is not the thing itself. Take a map of a college campus for example. Does the map feature the bench in
front of the library? Probably not, but if it does, does the map feature the scrape from some skateboard incident? No. So the map is wrong.
But it does not matter because models are only as useful as their intenteded purpose. For a new professor, the map is fine as it is. For a
bench repair person, they won't know which bench needs repairing so the model is useless.
