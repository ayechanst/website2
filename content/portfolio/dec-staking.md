This project allows users to pool money together and get their money back after two
conditions are met. First a certain amount of time needs to have passed, and second 
the a minumum threshold of money in the pool needs to be met. If the monetary goal
is met, then the stake was a success and users can use the pooled money to 
accomplish their larger goal. If the monetary goal is not met, then after a certain
amount of time users can get their money back and try again. In either case, no one
loses their money!

# Goals
1. Add money to the pool
2. Be able the withdraw money after a certain amount of time
3. Be able to withdraw the money if the threshold is not met

# Tools
