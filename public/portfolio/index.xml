      <description>This is a prototype of a full-blown decentralized application. It is called Domus DAO as Domus means home in Roman and I thought an epic app should have an epic name. The gist of the project is that people living in a communal living space can all join a DAO. In the DAO members are able to suggest tasks to be done around the house, and assign members to do the task.</description>

      <description>A Subgraph is an open-source and decetralized API with high data correctness that people can query from. A Substreams are a way of indexing blockchain data in a parallelizable way to query blockchain data very quickly. Subgraphs powered by Substreams allows for ready to use blockchain data without worrying about using a querying language. The specific goal of this project was to filter through mintings of a NFT project called Narcos.</description>

      <description>As a dungeon master for my pary adventuring through Icewind Dale, I wanted to build a tool that would make my job easier. Players visiting shops was a problem for me because shops have hundreds of items and sometimes shops don&amp;rsquo;t exactly have what players are looking for. So I turned to the internet to generate random stores for me, but none of them were satisfactory to my standards. So I started to create my own.</description>

      <description>This project allows users to pool money together and get their money back after two conditions are met. First a certain amount of time needs to have passed, and second the a minumum threshold of money in the pool needs to be met. If the monetary goal is met, then the stake was a success and users can use the pooled money to accomplish their larger goal. If the monetary goal is not met, then after a certain amount of time users can get their money back and try again.</description>

      <description>Block Paper Scissors is a game that uses a commit reveal scheme to make cheating impossible. The purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with building a front-end for a smart contract. The contract follows the same struture as a blog that demonstrated a rock paper scissors game, but the code was very broken and also did not properly implement the commit reveal scheme. I fixed the code and the scheme.</description>
