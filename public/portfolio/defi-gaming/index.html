        <p>Block Paper Scissors is a game that uses a commit reveal scheme to make cheating impossible.
The purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with building a front-end for a smart
contract. The contract follows the same struture as a blog that demonstrated a rock paper
scissors game, but the code was very broken and also did not properly implement the commit
reveal scheme. I fixed the code and the scheme.</p>

<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<ol>
<li>Allow a player to host a game</li>
<li>Allow a different player to join that same game</li>
<li>Have the players commit an answer with salt</li>
<li>Have the players reveal their answer at the same time</li>
<li>Compare the answers and determine a winner</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
<p>TypeScript, Solidity, Hardhat, Scaffold-eth 2, Ethers.js, Daisy-ui</p>
<h1 id="hosting-and-joining-a-game">Hosting and joining a game</h1>
<p>Player 1 creates a game by putting in the wallet address of their opponent.
There is an enum that changes from join phase, commit phase, reveal phase,
and results phase. While the player 1 waits for player 2 to join, the game
stays in the join phase which is the default phase. When player 2 joins, the
game moves on to the commit phase.</p>
<h1 id="commit-phase--problems">Commit phase &amp; problems</h1>
<p>Both players choose either rock, paper, or scissors, along with a salt, or
random data to mix up into their answer, so that their opponent cannot check
to see what that player picked. Originally the game had a function in the
smart contract that took in two arguments from the front end, which was the
players choice and the players salt. This was a big security problem because
etherscan and other websites that monitor the blockchain can read the argument
values. Because of this, players choices and salt were on public display. This
problem was fixed when I use the ethers.js library to hash player&rsquo;s answers in
the React component, instead of in the contract.</p>
<h1 id="reveal-phase">Reveal phase</h1>
<p>Once both players commit and salt their answers, the game state enum moves to
the reveal phase were players re-input their salt, so that the reveal function
can decrypt the hashed commit and compare the two players results.</p>
<h1 id="results-phase">Results phase</h1>
<p>This phase just displays who won.</p>

<li>It would be cool to add a betting mechanism since this game is so secure</li>
