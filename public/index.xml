      <description>Platinum Ethereum is a learning program designed to teach about the Ethereum Protocol using analogies all contained within a single cinematic universe. Why learn about a fictional universe if the goal is to learn about the Ethereum Protocol? Great questions and here&amp;rsquo;s why:&#xA;How do people memorize pi to the 70,000th digit? These people use special memorization techniques where they store information in the form of familiar objects and stories. The more creative and outlandish the story is, the better they store and retrieve information.</description>

      <description>Following along Speed Run Eth&amp;rsquo;s challenge #0 we will learn about the basics and commit to memory the following:&#xA;Accounts Wallets Transactions Smart Contracts Checkpoint 1: ‚õΩÔ∏è Gas &amp;amp; Wallets üëõ What is a wallet? Wallets manage accounts. There are two sorts of accounts, the accounts that wallets manage are EOA (Externally Owned Accounts). This means the account is owned by a private key.&#xA;But enough information and more analogies, lets start with learning about accounts with the following article:</description>

Looks like he didn&amp;rsquo;t see you. He grabs the huge private key on the desk and walks out the door leading to the platform.</description>

      <description>I want to write about how I think humans reason about things. It seems like the main structure holding understanding together are models. I&amp;rsquo;d argue that everyone has a model of everything they know and understand, and some models are simply better than others. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the specifics.&#xA;Models are always wrong Of course they are, because a model is not the thing itself. Take a map of a college campus for example.</description>

      <description>This is a prototype of a full-blown decentralized application. It is called Domus DAO as Domus means home in Roman and I thought an epic app should have an epic name. The gist of the project is that people living in a communal living space can all join a DAO. In the DAO members are able to suggest tasks to be done around the house, and assign members to do the task.</description>

      <description>A Subgraph is an open-source and decetralized API with high data correctness that people can query from. A Substreams are a way of indexing blockchain data in a parallelizable way to query blockchain data very quickly. Subgraphs powered by Substreams allows for ready to use blockchain data without worrying about using a querying language. The specific goal of this project was to filter through mintings of a NFT project called Narcos.</description>

      <description>As a dungeon master for my pary adventuring through Icewind Dale, I wanted to build a tool that would make my job easier. Players visiting shops was a problem for me because shops have hundreds of items and sometimes shops don&amp;rsquo;t exactly have what players are looking for. So I turned to the internet to generate random stores for me, but none of them were satisfactory to my standards. So I started to create my own.</description>

First a certain amount of time needs to have passed, and second the a minumum threshold of money in the pool needs to be met. If the monetary goal is met, then the stake was a success and users can use the pooled money to accomplish their larger goal. If the monetary goal is not met, then after a certain amount of time users can get their money back and try again.</description>

      <description>Block Paper Scissors is a game that uses a commit reveal scheme to make cheating impossible. The purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with building a front-end for a smart contract. The contract follows the same struture as a blog that demonstrated a rock paper scissors game, but the code was very broken and also did not properly implement the commit reveal scheme. I fixed the code and the scheme.</description>

      <description>My first name is Aye Chan with a space in it, it causes a lot of confusion. I was born in France, and I am passionate about philosophy, cooking, nature, people, and programming.&#xA;Education I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a fan of conventional public schooling, other than all the interesting people who come from all walks of life. Pre-college, I went to schools in California, Hawaii, and Florida. After highschool I graduated from the Univeristy of West Florida where I discovered my passion for philosophy.</description>

      <description>I studied philosophy in college and my favorite classes were the philosophy of science, and critical thinking. I also enjoyed my aesthetic classes like the philosophy of art, the philosophy of film, and the philosophy of mind. Classes I like a bit less was modern philosophy which covered thinkers between 1600-1800.&#xA;Personal interest in existentialism Existentialism is probably my favorite type of philosophy because it helped me cope with starting my adult life, away from parental guidance, my obligations as a son, and my rigorous swim career.</description>

      <description>ayechan@pop-os:~/about/journey&#xA;I got into crypto and web development my senior year of college after a long talk with the chairman of the philosophy department. I studied philosophy in college and I was entertaining the thought of continuing my education and eventually become a philosophy professor. My passion for philosophy has no bounds, but the social and hierarchical structure of academia along with its obligations did not match with my life philosophy, so I decided to go a different route.</description>
