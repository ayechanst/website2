      <description>My first name is Aye Chan with a space in it, it causes a lot of confusion. I was born in France, and I am passionate about philosophy, cooking, nature, people, and programming.
Education I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a fan of conventional public schooling, other than all the interesting people who come from all walks of life. Pre-college, I went to schools in California, Hawaii, and Florida. After highschool I graduated from the Univeristy of West Florida where I discovered my passion for philosophy.</description>

My passion for philosophy has no bounds, but the social and hierarchical structure of academia along with its obligations did not match with my life philosophy, so I decided to go a different route.</description>
