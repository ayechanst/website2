        <h1>Philosophical Interests</h1>
    </header>
    
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>I studied philosophy in college and my favorite classes were the
philosophy of science, and critical thinking. I also enjoyed my aesthetic
classes like the philosophy of art, the philosophy of film, and the
philosophy of mind. Classes I like a bit less was modern philosophy which
covered thinkers between 1600-1800.</p>
<h1 id="personal-interest-in-existentialism">Personal interest in existentialism</h1>
<p>Existentialism is probably my favorite type of philosophy because it helped
me cope with starting my adult life, away from parental guidance, my
obligations as a son, and my rigorous swim career. I was studying marine
biology and partying in college, and not really going anywhere in life. My
subconscious felt this cognitive dissonance between what I expected of myself
and what my actions were. I was just existing a mediocre existance and studying
existentialism helped me build a frame work for myself that made me happy.</p>
<p>The main tennet of existentialism is that one doesn&rsquo;t choose their time period
of birth, their geographical location, or their level of wealth. People just
&ldquo;spawn&rdquo; out of their mother&rsquo;s womb where and whenever and then they must choose
what to do with their life. It was a scary yet comforting thought in that
people can choose to do whatever, and they have limited time to do so before
their eventual death.</p>
<p>Nietzsche solved my existential dread and lack of life direction with his saying
that happiness is the feeling that resistance is being overcome. As a swimmer
in highschool, my happiness came from the difficulty of being a great swimmer.
However nothing in life was resisting against me in college, except for life
itself but I was not doing anything to overcome that resistance. That is when
I switched my major to philosophy, and started programming, and seeking things
out that would be a challenge so I could overcome that resistance.</p>
<h1 id="personal-interest-in-post-modernism">Personal interest in post-modernism</h1>
<p>My interest in post-modernism stems from school, and the post-modern ideas
they pushed in so many different classes. I do not agree with post-modernism
and its outlook on the world,
and I was curious about where these ideas came from in the first place. My
interest in post-modernism comes from how much I disagree with its thesis.
Post-modernism&rsquo;s own logic invalidates itself and I seek to understand why
anyone would subscribe to its claims. Whether I agree with the tennets of
post-modernism or not does not change that it is an interesting field of
philosophy and contributing to its body of work is one way of making it
better.</p>
